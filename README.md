# Lab 8

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

# Description

This is the first time I have used the Numpy library. There are so many useful equations and functions to utilize.

In this lab I used the slicing method, but I did not add a stop step, so this means that the value will go to the
end of the array.
